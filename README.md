This is the [CloudBees](https://www.cloudbees.com/products/feature-management) provider implementation for [OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev/) for the [Python SDK](https://github.com/open-feature/python-sdk).

OpenFeature provides a vendor-agnostic abstraction layer on Feature Flag management.

This provider allows the use of CloudBees Feature Management as a backend for Feature Flag configurations.

## Requirements
- python 3.8 or higher

## Installation

### Add it to your build

```

### Confirm peer dependencies are installed
